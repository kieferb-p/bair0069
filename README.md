Hello, my name is Kiefer. I am a passionate and dedicated learner with a strong background in mobile application development. I have experience with a variety of programming languages, including among many: JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, and React/Native. My interests include creating music, reading about psychology, and playing chess, and I am always seeking new experiences and opportunities to grow my knowledge. I am currently studying mobile application design and development at Algonquin College and am excited to collaborate on any project that will allow me to utilize my skills and continue learning. You can reach me on
